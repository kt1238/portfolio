            <h3>Transforming a Watchlist into a Database</h3>
            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>
                I have a secret. Every time someone tells me about a movie or show I put it into my watchlist. 
                It's gotten really long. I would say unmanageable at this point. So I decided to clean it up using
                some skills I learned at university.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can have a look at the file for yourself <a href="resources/Movies_Series_Books_Music.txt" target="_blank">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                As you can see the list has started to develop its own language
                <ul>
                    <li>✓ means that I have seen the movie</li>
                    <li>The length of these lines (!----!) indicate how eager I am to watch the movie.</li>
                    <li>Additional information such as year of release or genre is stored in brackets.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's walk through the steps.
            </p>
            <h4>1. Make A Copy</h4>
            <p>
                Before you do anything with data you care about, you should make a copy of it. It sounds simple enough
                but forgetting to do it can have serious consequences.
            </p>
            <h4>2. Divide Up The Problem</h4>
            <p>
                It would be very difficult to extract useful data from all parts of the watchlist at the same time.
                For example, the columns associated with movies(director, release date) and comics(author,num_issues) are different.
                Instead I am going to focus on the movies section first.
                The modified list is <a href="resources/movies.txt" target="_blank">here</a>.
            </p>
            <h4>3. Formatting into a CSV file with Python</h4>
            <p>
                The <a href="resources/format.py" target="_blank">program</a> I have created opens up the .txt file, reads each line sequentially, formats it and writes it to a new .csv file.
            </p>
            <p><em>Figure 1: The .csv file generated by the program.</em></p>
            <img src="resources/output.png" alt="A csv file sample">
            <p>
                I had to make some alterations to the original .txt file by hand
                <ul>
                    <li>remove unclosed brackets</li>
                    <li>joined separate language sections and added language in () instead</li>
                    <li>split up lines containing multiple movies</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h4>4. Loading the CSV file into a Database</h4>
            <p>
                I am using MySQL as my database. To interact with MySQL I made use of the <code>mysql.connector</code> library recommended by its creators.
                This allowed me to pass SQL commands to the database using Python.
                The script I used to upload the values can be found <a href="resources/upload.py" target="_blank">here</a>.
            </p>
            <h4>5. Creating a Front End</h4>
            <p>
                I have now successfully created a database! However the average user cannot view my movie list (unless they know SQL) ☹️. <br>
                And adding or modifying movies through SQL queries is a bit clunky. To fix this I created a web application using Django.
            </p>
            <h4>6. Future Improvements</h4>
            <ul>
				<li><del>Use Django templating language for web app.</del></li>
                <li>Movie titles can contain commas which inteferes with a csv format.</li>
				<li>Improve extract functions in formatter.</li>
				<li>Increase range of genres.</li>
				<li>Movies can have multiple genres.</li>
				<li>Store poster for each movie (scrape from web?).</li>
				<li>Scrape information about movies from web so more records are complete.</li>
				<li>Random recommendation not very helpful, make a recommendation base on inputs?</li>
				<li>Better search engine - use a plugin?</li>
				<li>Visualisations of count per genre, ratings over time, etc.</li>
            </ul>
